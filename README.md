## What is Hacky Hour

Hacky Hour means different things at different Universities/Institutes.
At the University of Iowa, Hacky Hour is an informal gathering of people
to share knowledge and ask questions about their data and how to code
analyses for their data.

## Anyone is Welcome

If you have data and questions, but don't know where/how to even start
answering those question, you are welcome at Hacky Hour.

If you have some experience with data analysis and coding, but have
a couple quick questions, you are welcome at Hacky Hour.

If you are very experienced, but want to connect with other people
working on interesting problems (or start a project), you are welcome
at Hacky Hour.

No matter your experience level, check us out!
